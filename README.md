# mashup-frontend

This is the frontend part of the mashup project. The website is used to help users to subscribe to the bot. The actual subscribing happens by sending a Tweet to the bot, but the website helps the users by making the Tweet ready to send for them.

Users type in the HSL line they want to subscribe to (or unsubscribe from), which will create corresponding Twitter buttons that can be pressed to form a Tweet. After that, the users only have to send the Tweet, and they are set. The frontend queries the HSL API for the transportation lines.

Further information on how the mashup works can be acquired by studying the code, as it is (IMO) documented and construced well enough.
